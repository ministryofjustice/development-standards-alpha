# Documentation

## Readme
All projects should have a readme in markdown format in the route of the repository. Which contains sufficent information on the technologies in use, and how to run and develop the project.

## Restful Api's
All Restful api endpoints should be documented using swagger (springfox), along with details
on all required parameters (including headers). And contain an example with suitable default values to test against.
