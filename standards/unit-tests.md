# Unit Testing
## Common
 - Use test driven development
 - Unit tests should test only one thing, and at a method level
 - Mock everything that is not being tested directly
 - Test names & assert statements should make the purpose of the test clear
 - Code coverage (branch & line) should increase or remain stable not decrease on each commit
 - Use Assertions Instead of Print Statements
 - Test negative scenarios and borderline cases, in addition to positive scenarios
 - Build tests that have deterministic results (e.g. tests involving date/times)

## Java
