# Submitting Code

 - All changes should be done on a branch specific to a story
 - Squash commits and rebase against master before creating a PR
- All work must have an associated story and where possible merged to master in a single commit (allows for better release management).
- Code should never be pushed directly to master, but submitted as a PR for review
- Code should be reviewed and given at least one thumb up before merging.
- If possible functionality should be demonstrated on a branch to the product owner prior to merging.
